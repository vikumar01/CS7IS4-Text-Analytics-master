# Text-Analytics

The primary goal of this project is motivated by the work of analyzing sections of texts from
books to identify its authors. Authors can be distinguished by their writing style, and the project aims
to classify authors based on their writing style. This paper has used meta-features based and content
based approaches to identify their association towards author attribution and accuracy is calculated
using different classifier models and TF-IDF vectorizer. It was observed that TF-IDF combined with
ridge regression gave the best result whereas meta-features based approach had a more consistent
result with different classifiers.
